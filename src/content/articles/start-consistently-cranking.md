## A fresh coat of ideas

Five years ago almost to the day, I started a newsletter called *Plan Your Next*.

Less than a year in, I quit writing, with ideas and talent as scarce as the hair on a Sphynx cat. (God, those creatures freak me out.)

Three years ago, in a dramatic game-winning-come-from-behind-home-run-smash-to-right-field-with-bases-loaded fashion, I plucked the newsletter from near death and started writing every Sunday.

Then I built a two-day workshop called Approachable Design and coasted for a while. Then, Approachable Design started to become more than that. But I wasn't giving it enough dedicated attention.

So with a new site, and a fresh newsletter to focus on what some people like to call a [Personal Monopoly](https://perell.com/note/build-a-personal-monopoly?utm_source=approachabledesign&utm_medium=email), I'm bringing my mistakes, my wins, my past career, my new creator career, many illustrations, ideas, and personal stories to this new format called, *Make It Yours*.

I'm also a control freak and this new format lets me have power-hungry dictatorship-like control over everything I create. (I'll write a longer post on why I chose ConvertKit over Substack in the future)

*Make It Yours* is about learning to make better design decisions to stand out from the crowd. To build something you're proud of, and to embrace your taste. *(Damn, maybe I should have named it that?)*

**You're here now because you've joined me on one of those two paths, and this is my evolution to build something audacious.**

Starting a new idea means you sometimes need to consolidate, remove, cut, demolish, or skin. Starting is the easy part though.

Consistently cranking is where you make real progress.

## 🎨 Better Design Decisions

- ​[What do the home pages of 10 creative entrepreneurs have in common?](https://twitter.com/jspector/status/1673044526221631488?utm_source=approachabledesign&utm_medium=email): #3 is less about design but I still see too many people talking about themselves and not how they can help the reader.
- ​[Get inspired by my growing collection of hand-picked websites](/products/design-vault): My design vault that I'll be adding to upwards of 1,000 organized and hand-picked sites.
- [Even a low-fi (but well-formatted) website can stand out](https://nat.org/?utm_source=approachabledesign&utm_medium=email): The web is 95% text, and if you can learn to wield text correctly, even a simple layout without any color can be effective.
- [Incredible—and hilarious—thread of "rebrands"](https://twitter.com/cpaik/status/1672781488683724800?utm_source=approachabledesign&utm_medium=email): My fav is *Skipping breakfast > Intermittent fasting*. ☠️☠️

Your friend in design,
