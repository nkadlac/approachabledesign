If you have a product or service offering, the single most important page to turn onlookers into customers is a landing page.

**But first, I want to invite you to a live **[​**YouTube thumbnail workshop**​](https://lu.ma/wb6g2xk2)**. I’m hosting it with Paul Millerd, author of the Pathless Path *****(Self-published and has sold 30k copies!)*****.**

🎨 How to design a newsletter landing page

📣 Build a site using Framer in minutes

💻 How do you want your audience to feel?

![Divider line](https://framerusercontent.com/images/w9Pz4gQxbVagyYJi0eRCmpJ6Zw.png)Not long ago, I received an inbound email from a prospect.

Old Nate would email back promptly, fielding the request swiftly, and engage in a back-and-forth email thread over needs, desires, and pain points. After a week or three, finally sending over a proposal and making the offer.

Another version of old Nate would be to ask for the budget ahead of time—and straight up turn it down if it wasn't of ideal size.

The problem with these approaches is how much time is spent going back and forth, negotiating, miscommunicating, and finally pitching the cost.

But new and improved 'Landing Page Nate' took a breath, then spent two hours spinning up a landing page to provide the value upfront, complete with pricing, irresistible offer details, bonuses, and testimonials from prior related projects.

Within 48 hours I had the sign-off and quickly signed on 8k of revenue. It wasn't a large project, but now I have a page I can use for similar offers of future projects.

Landing pages are typically the first interaction someone might have with your product or service, and I want to talk about how to design a page that helps convert customers (without being manipulative).

What I loved about the party is how Khe made it his own. No frills—just good people in a good space can create magic.

Next week, we'll dig into a more comprehensive designed landing page if you're trying to build demand for a waitlist.

Your friend in design,
