This week I launched a new product for [​**designing thumbnails**​](https://approachabledesign.co/products/youtube-masterclass) and learned a lot about how to walk the line between the act of building and the act of selling.

Transitioning from writing about anything with a focus on building something can catch people off guard.

### **Two lessons that might be helpful:**

**1) I lost many subscribers, *****but I knew this would happen*****.** I am focused on being the [​**Yoda to your Luke**​](http://www.jessedesjardins.com/thoughts/2021/4/3/being-yoda?utm_source=approachabledesign&utm_medium=email). You're the hero, and I am here to help your brand or business grow. This might mean more emails when the time comes, but to have built that trust ahead of time.

**2) Test before you sell**

I wasn't sure how this would go, because it was so niche. Of course, not everyone here has a YouTube channel, so it was bound to be small.

But testing this product out as a free workshop showed me that there was some demand, and forced me to build it in real-time.

I believe this is one of the best (and fastest) ways to go from idea > product when you're not sure and haven't tested the idea. The only cringe-inducing part in my mind is the marketing of the event. However, I want to thank [​**Paul Millerd**​](https://boundless.substack.com/?utm_source=approachabledesign&utm_medium=email) for being someone who [​**pushed me**​](https://twitter.com/p_millerd/status/1678379606187859968?s=20) into the uncomfortable and made the whole experience much more enjoyable.

I've already started jamming on live design ideas with [​**Khe Hy**​](https://radreads.co/?utm_source=approachabledesign&utm_medium=email) (founder of Rad Reas), **so I'd love to hear what you want us to cover related to design and branding!**

[​**HGTV is making our homes boring and sad**​](https://www.washingtonpost.com/home/2023/07/07/hgtv-makes-homes-boring-sad): *"...neutrals reign supreme, and the goal is to create a place that is inoffensive and that could appeal to many." *I will die on this hill. **Minimalism is the default choice because it's the least offensive choice.**

[​**Japan's design choices are next level**​](https://twitter.com/michellehuang42/status/1661497995588763659): My favorite is the rotating street bus in the thread.

Thanks for being here this week. It was a big week and I'm glad you stuck around.

We're potty training our 2-year-old daughter this weekend so it's been incredibly eventful!

Special thanks to [​**Heidi (Sew Heidi)**​](https://successfulfashiondesigner.com/?utm_source=approachabledesign&utm_medium=email) for her encouragement and help in the past week.

On tap for next week will be the third installment of my landing page series and the behind-the-scenes of building out my own [​**Design Vault**​](https://approachabledesign.co/products/design-vault) landing page.

Your friend in design,
