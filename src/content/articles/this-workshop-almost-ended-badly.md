🎨 How we redesigned a podcast

💻 20 Design tips for non-designers

![Divider line](/images/articles/w9Pz4gQxbVagyYJi0eRCmpJ6Zw.png.webp)90 minutes into a design workshop with over 30 people watching, I felt lost.

A couple of weeks ago, my friend Khe Hy (Founder of RadReads) and I hosted a Podcast Cover workshop.

​The goal was to redesign his podcast cover artwork in two hours.

Exactly 100 people registered, and we took the entire time to redesign his podcast.

We used a compressed version of the Inside Out design method I take all my clients through. It reveals themes that even you don't know will surface.

During the workshop, I was asked if getting outside feedback was part of my process.

100% no.

A chef doesn't ask his customers to come and comment on the meal while it's being prepared.

And, design is similar.

But, for entertainment purposes, it's a fun experiment even if it's not natural to design live in front of a large group of commentators.

Through this process, we explored themes through Khe's stories and experiences that helped make his design decisions timeless.

Here's Khe's podcast art before and after.

​At the end of the session, I was 95% there but needed to play with the colors a bit more.

​We ended on a positive Q&A, but I felt exhausted. Thankfully with just a few tweaks, it came together within minutes.

​I highly recommend checking out Khe's podcast, [**The Examined Life**](https://open.spotify.com/show/40D06BjbvSZvvRlLu1N8lf?si=169e74e8562b425b).

​Khe now has a design kit to serve as a starting point for his design projects.
