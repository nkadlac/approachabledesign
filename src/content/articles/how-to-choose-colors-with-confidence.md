​This is the most common design question I get from creators.

When you make decisions about color, you’re also making decisions about your identity, and how the world perceives you.

Apple designers studied this resource of the water drop when designing the first aqua interface for Mac OSX. When using drop shadows or gradients, study how they interact with the real world first. *(Day 5 in the *[***80/20 Design challenge***](https://approachabledesign.co/courses/8020-design-challenge)*)*
