        <div class="prose prose-lg prose-light">
          <p>
            I spent 18+ years as a brand and product designer working with early-stage startups and Fortune 500 companies.
          </p>

          <p>
            My last role was as Creative Director for a real estate based startup that I helped build over seven years. It was acquired in 2021 in the mid-eight figures.
          </p>

          <p>
            Working in these senior roles have been rewarding, but I was looking for freedom.
          </p>

          <p>
            I started to get back to basics, and started writing online. I developed my own creative routines inspired by people like Julia Cameron and Austin Kleon. I searched for what truly made me happy, and I found it in teaching design to non-designers.
          </p>

          <p>
            My goal is to take my experience and knowledge and distill it down into approachable and meaningful products and experiences, helping people like you have the superpower of bringing the future to the present.
          </p>

          <p>
            Designers have had this ability all along, and I want to teach it to you.
