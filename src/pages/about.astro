        <!-- Story -->
        <div class="prose prose-lg">
          <p>
            I spent 18+ years in brand and product design roles, including a Creative Director position at a startup that was acquired in 2021.
          </p>

          <p>
            After the acquisition, I realized something: most people struggle with design not because they lack talent, but because no one taught them the fundamentals in an approachable way.
          </p>

          <p>
            So I started <strong>Approachable Design</strong>—a place where non-designers can learn to build authentic brands, create professional visuals, and develop their design eye without needing a design degree.
          </p>

          <h2>What I believe</h2>

          <p>
            Design shouldn't be gatekept by professionals. The ability to communicate visually, tell stories with copy, and connect through branding should be accessible to everyone.
          </p>

          <p>
            The world is a better place when we can confidently reflect our inner taste with the world around us.
          </p>
